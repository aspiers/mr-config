- Write default_checkout function

  global lib should have

      checkout = default_checkout

  and sh.d

          register_upstream () {
              case "$1" in
                  github)
                      MR_UPSTREAM_URL=`github_clone_url`
                      ;;
                  ...
              esac
          }
          

  which will allow

      [foo]
      lib = register_upstream github

- make sure I've forked every git repo I use and have that as default upstream
